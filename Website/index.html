    <h4>
    The goal of this project was to create a fully autonomous robotic guitar that uses motors to play any<br>
    song that is input into to the system (both strumming and fretting). We hope to bridge the gap between art and<br>
    engineering, as well as foster interest in STEM fields using music: a universal language that anyone can appreciate.<br>
    It works by using a custom algorithm running in Python on a microcontroller to take in music data and precisely<br>
    time the outputs of various servo motors (which are mounted on the acoustic guitar) to play the given song.<br>
    It's very difficult to find other projects that do this, and existing ones tend to be quite expensive ($1000+)<br>
    whereas we believe we can fit our entire scope under a budget of $600. Although the project's main application<br>
    is for entertainment, it can also be used as a teaching instrument for both music and engineering design principles!<br>
